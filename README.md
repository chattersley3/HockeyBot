## Works in Progress
*These Cogs are a work in progress and have limited to no functionality at the moment. Feel free to leave ideas or suggestions!*

| Name | Status | Description (Click to see full status)
| --- | --- | --- |
| Halo | **Work in Progress**| <details><summary>Cogs for accessing information from the Halo video games API systems. </summary></details> |
| Chatter | **Alpha** | <details><summary>Currently disabled until I can work on it.</summary>Teach your bot how to talk by watching conversations on servers and reply. Uses chatterbot library. NOTE: This cog is not recommended to be used at this time. After a month of usage it caused the whole bot to slow down while it searched for responses. I recommend looking at cleverbot for the time being.</details> |
